# VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS Classes

## Value semantics

### **Class `CLASS-WITH-VALUE-SEMANTICS`**

A metaclass whose metainstances are automatically comparable slotwise via `EQV`.

### **Class `OBJECT-WITH-VALUE-SEMANTICS`**

An automatic subclass of all instances of every `CLASS-WITH-VALUE-SEMANTICS`.

```lisp
VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (defclass foo () 
                         ((slot :initarg :slot))
                         (:metaclass class-with-value-semantics))
#<CLASS-WITH-VALUE-SEMANTICS VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::FOO>

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (eqv (make-instance 'foo)
                            (make-instance 'foo))
T

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (eqv (make-instance 'foo :slot 42)
                            (make-instance 'foo :slot 42))
T

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (eqv (make-instance 'foo :slot 42)
                            (make-instance 'foo))
NIL

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (eqv (make-instance 'foo :slot 42)
                            (make-instance 'foo :slot "42"))
;;; WARNING: EQV default method called with (42 "42"); possible type error?
NIL

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (eqv (make-instance 'foo :slot (make-instance 'foo))
                            (make-instance 'foo :slot (make-instance 'foo)))
T

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (defclass bar () 
                         ((slot :initarg :slot))
                         (:metaclass class-with-value-semantics))
#<CLASS-WITH-VALUE-SEMANTICS VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::BAR>

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (eqv (make-instance 'foo :slot 42)
                            (make-instance 'bar :slot 42))
NIL
```

## Always-bound

### **Class `ALWAYS-BOUND-CLASS`**

A metaclass whose instances are meant to never have their slots unbound.

### **Class `ALWAYS-BOUND-OBJECT`**

An automatic subclass of all instances of every `ALWAYS-BOUND-CLASS`.

```lisp
VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (defclass baz () 
                         ((slot :initarg :slot))
                         (:metaclass always-bound-class))
#<ALWAYS-BOUND-CLASS VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::BAZ>

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (make-instance 'baz)
;;; Error: The slot VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::SLOT is unbound in the object #<BAZ {10026C0E93}>.
;;;    [Condition of type UNBOUND-SLOT]

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (make-instance 'baz :slot 42)
#<BAZ {100290BE73}>

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (slot-makunbound * 'slot)
;;; Error: The slot VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::SLOT is unbound in the object #<BAZ {100290BE73}>.
;;;   [Condition of type UNBOUND-SLOT]
;;;
;;; Aborting to toplevel.

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (slot-value * 'slot)
42
```

For an always-bound object, the following should hold true:

* Attempting to initialize an instance with an unbound slot should signal an `unbound-slot` error.
* Reinitializing an instance should, by definition, never introduce unbound slots in a class, but *just to be absolutely sure*, attempting to reinitialize an instance with an unbound slot should signal an `unbound-slot` error.
* Redefining an always-bound class in a way that would cause an instance to gain an unbound slot should cause *any* accesses to that instance to repeatedly signal an `unbound-slot` error until the class is redefined in a way which no longer results in the instance gaining an unbound slot.
* Attempting to change the class of an instance to an always-bound class in a way that would cause an instance to gain an unbound slot should signal an `unbound-slot` error.
* Calling `slot-makunbound` on an instance should - guess what - signal an `unbound-slot` error.

All errors signaled from the above situations should be correctable via both `use-value` and `store-value` restarts available; both of these restarts should work the same, as the provided value will be stored in the slot, after which execution will continue.

TODO: change this to only offer a `store-value` restart.

## Typechecking

### **Class `TYPECHECKED-CLASS`**

A metaclass with mandatory runtime typechecking for slot values. Subclasses `ALWAYS-BOUND-CLASS`.

### **Class `TYPECHECKED-OBJECT`**

An automatic subclass of all instances of every `TYPECHECKED-CLASS`.

```lisp
VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (defclass quux ()
                         ((slot :initarg :slot :type integer))
                         (:metaclass typechecked-class))
#<TYPECHECKED-CLASS VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::QUUX>

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (make-instance 'quux)
;;; Error: The slot VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS::SLOT is unbound in the object #<QUUX {1005907C23}>.
;;;   [Condition of type UNBOUND-SLOT]

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (make-instance 'quux :slot "42")
;;; Error: The value "42" is not of type INTEGER.
;;;   [Condition of type TYPE-ERROR]

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (make-instance 'quux :slot 42)
#<QUUX {1005C9A643}>

VALUE-SEMANTICS-UTILS> (setf (slot-value * 'slot) "42")
;;; Error: The value "42" is not of type INTEGER.
;;;   [Condition of type TYPE-ERROR]
```

For a typechecked object, the following should hold true:

* Attempting to initialize an instance with a mistyped slot should signal a `type-error` error.
* Attempting to reinitialize an instance with a mistyped slot should signal a `type-error` error.
* Redefining an typeched class in a way that would cause an instance to gain a mistyped slot should cause *any* accesses to that instance to repeatedly signal an`type-error` error until the class is redefined in a way which no longer results in the instance gaining a mistyped slot.
* Attempting to change the class of an instance to a typechecked class in a way that would cause an instance to gain a mistyped slot should signal a `type-error` error.
* Calling `setf slot-value` on an instance with a mistyped new value should - guess what - signal a `type-error` error.

All errors signaled from the above situations should be correctable via both `use-value` and `store-value` restarts available; both of these restarts should work the same, as the provided value will be stored in the slot, after which execution will continue.

TODO: change this to only offer a `store-value` restart.

## The final formâ„¢

### **Class `TYPECHECKED-CLASS-WITH-VALUE-SEMANTICS`**

A metaclass composing the above three metaclasses.
